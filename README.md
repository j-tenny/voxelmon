The goal of voxelmon is to produce voxelized leaf area density metrics from lidar, then produce vegetation metrics for wildfire risk modeling, 
treatment effect monitoring, hydrology analysis, wildlife habitat suitability, and more. Look through the scripts folder to find examples of package usage and
reach out to jt893@nau.edu with any questions. Scripts to recreate the analysis from the publication "Canopy and surface fuels measurement using 
terrestrial lidar single-scan approach in the Mogollon highlands of Arizona" are located in the branch final_analysis_tenny_et_al_2025. The
master branch will be updated with newer algorithms and pipelines for additional data sources. Currently the package is
compatible with single- and multiple- scan data from the Leica BLK 360 with processing for ALS and UAV lidar in development.
